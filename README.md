# Python-Network-Scanner
Python network scanner i made to get familiar with using Linux and Python together

# How to use  
Not too hard.  
• Download the file to your linux distribution of choice  
• Make sure you have python3 installed  
• Run "sudo python3 Scanz0r.py"  
• You'll be prompted for an IP address or hostname. Leave blank for localhost  
• Choose options by typing 1-9  
• Press 0 to confirm  
• Wait  
• Once the scan is done you'll see the results in your terminal  
• Optionally, you can export the results to a .json file. (If the output file doesn't exist the program will make one, otherwise it'll append to the existing file)
